Instagram Feed WD is the best Instagram plugin for WordPress to go with. It is a simple Instagram plugin that comes with a user-friendly management and easy setup, and lets you embed custom Instagram feeds of hashtags and users to your website in just a couple of minutes. You can embed Instagram galleries  and entire timelines to your posts using a shortcode or using the plugin’s  Instagram widget on your sidebar. You don’t need to install Instagram widget, or add any Instagram code. 0ur plugin comes with a free Instagram widget letting you display Instagram social feeds, photos, images as well as Instagram video feeds.

It’s fully customizable and the most feature-packed simple Instagram feed plugin for WordPress . It’s a simple WordPress plugin for Instagram designed for users who want to bring this widely popular social network to their websites and share Instagram pics with their visitors. 

Instagram Feed WD allows displaying custom feeds based on public Instagram accounts and hashtags. You can create mixed feeds based on multiple accounts, multiple hashtags or any combination of both with the Pro version. This WordPress Instagram plugin uses 4 layouts – 2 layouts for smaller thumbnail display (Thumbnail and Masonry views) and 2 for larger images (Blog Style and Image Browser views). Thumbnail view displays images with their metadata (Pro): caption, number of likes and comments. Image Browser displays single image with navigation possibility, metadata (Pro): image caption, number of likes and comments. Masonry  layout (Pro) displays images in beautiful Instagram masonry view combining the image and its metadata (Pro). Blog Style layout (Pro)combines large image with its data similar creating a blog style display. All the layouts can display feed username and its metadata (bio, number of posts and followers).Also the plugin supports Instagram grid view which will give a distinct style to your website. It would be a perfect fit for photography websites, and for users who want to showcase beautiful Instagram galleries ,latest images and videos in their posts and pages. 

Use Conditional Filters to display filtered feeds (Pro). This feature will let you filter out images and photos from the feeds based on the conditions you specify. Setting a filter is simple.Set up a filter logic (to hide or display posts), choose condition type (username, hashtag, mention,description, Instagram media link), fill in the condition and display filtered feeds. Feeds can have multiple filters. It’s a great way to show only those Instagram posts and images that your visitors would like to scroll through.

Images can be redirected to Instagram page or opened in a lightbox. You can set sorting for the images (date, likes, comments, random) as well as define the order (ascending/descending). In case of combined feeds you can use front-end filtering by clicking on specific hashtag or username. The lightbox displays Instagram pictures as a slideshow with different transition effects (Pro). In the Pro version of the plugin its Instagram lightbox also supports media caption, comments, social share buttons and filmstrip,making it an elegant advanced tool for viewing Instagram feed.

Theme section (available with Pro version) allows to customize colors, sizes and display styles. Each layout uses its own theme which makes this section even more compelling.

The plugin is responsive and scales perfectly for mobile Instagram users.

No feed data is stored in the database. All the images, videos (Pro), captions and comments  are retrieved directly from the Instagram in the front-end, which makes this WordPress Instagram gallery plugin fast and very easy to use.

Conditional filters can be used for both displaying or skipping certain images. Filters are also applicable to mixed feeds. This is a a good way to display Instagram stream content that your users are most interested in to scroll through.

All provided usernames and/or hashtags will be used as initial source. Filters will be applied to feed generated on this selection.Filter Logic. Filter logic allows displaying one of the options:
And - Displays Instagram posts which correspond to all filters. Or - Displays Instagram posts which correspond to at least one of the filters.Nor - Hides Instagram posts which correspond to at least one of the filters. Add Condition. Write your condition, select condition type and click on Add New Condition. You can add as many conditions as you want repeating the process. You can add different condition types mixed together as well. Condition might be username (use @ before the username), hashtag (use # before the keyword), text or link (provide full URL) depending on condition type. Let’s discuss each condition type separately:
Username. Useful when you have a feed based on hashtags. It will allow displaying feeds of only certain accounts using that hashtag. Let’s consider you have #panda and #animal hashtags, you can set @natgeo and @instapandacool to display images from these two accounts. Hashtag. Useful when you have a feed based on usernames. It will allow displaying feeds using only certain hashtag, e.g. if you have @bmw and @instacars as users and want to display only posts containing #bmw hashtag. Mention. This can be used both in cases of hashtag and usernames, e.g. displaying posts where @moby is mentioned. Description. This can be used both with hashtags and usernames. This can be a single keyword or word combination which should be used within the Instagram post description. Instagram Media Link. This is the shareable link of the Instagram post. The entire URL should be used for serving as a filter.Result. Here you will see all of the added filters which will be applied to your feed.This feature is widely used on Instagram for eCommerce websites, as it serves like an Instagram feed with analytics.

Instagram Feed WD comes with detailed themes section, but if you want to make specific style changes you can also use
Custom CSS field located in Instagram Feed> Settings.
Custom Javascript can be found within the same location of Instagram WD.

A Custom Javascript event is available for scripts to run after all Instagram feed images are loaded.
Suppose you have feed with thumbnails view and besides displaying your feed you want to open up captions for some photos. You can achieve this by assigning our custom wdi_feed_loaded event to feed container and set callback function for that event.
Here is quick example how to open up captions for images with 0,1,2,3 indexes.
jQuery('#wdi_feed_0').on('wdi_feed_loaded',function(){
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(0).trigger('click');
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(1).trigger('click');
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(2).trigger('click');
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(3).trigger('click');
  });
